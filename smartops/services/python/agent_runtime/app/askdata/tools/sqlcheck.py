"""Silent, deterministic sanity check on generated SQL — logged, never shown to the user.

Normal mode skips the Verifier, so nothing independently reviews the query. This does not replace
that, and it does not change any answer: it writes one log line when the SQL looks risky, so the
rate can be monitored and the mode boundary revisited with data rather than opinion.

NOTHING HERE IS SPECIFIC TO ANY DATABASE. Every rule is derived at runtime from the introspected
schema block that is already built for the prompts:

  * join keys      - from the `FK:` lines the introspection emits
  * duplicate keys - from the `⚠ MANY ROWS PER` markers introspection adds when a table holds
                     more rows than distinct key values
  * fraction cols  - from column names the schema reports, checked against how they are used

Point the app at a different database and the checks follow it, with no code change.
